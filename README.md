# Automated Novel Data Collection and Management System

## Project Experience

### Project Details

**Efficient Data Scraping and Management:** In this project, I developed an automated novel data collection and management system. By using paths as indices, I successfully prevented duplicate scraping of the same articles, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.

**Object-Oriented Architecture and Inheritance:** I employed object-oriented programming principles, modeling each novel as a distinct class and creating different types of novels through inheritance. This design promotes code reusability and minimizes redundancy.

**Jenkins Continuous Integration:** To ensure timely data updates, I integrated Jenkins into the project, achieving continuous integration. Whenever new articles are available for collection, the system automatically triggers the scraping and updating process.

**MongoDB Database Management:** I chose MongoDB as the database engine, storing each novel as an independent object. Utilizing paths as indices not only prevents redundant scraping but also enhances data query efficiency.

**User Interface Enhancement:** To better showcase the data, I developed a sleek and intuitive user interface, allowing users to easily browse and access various types of novel data.

### Gains and Impact

**Technical Practice and Application:** Through this project, I gained valuable experience in object-oriented programming and automated data handling, showcasing my technical proficiency.

**Continuous Integration Implementation:** Integrating Jenkins' continuous integration mechanism ensures real-time data updates and enhances my understanding and application of continuous integration workflows.

**Database Management Skills:** Leveraging MongoDB as the database engine, I adeptly implemented data storage and retrieval, while efficiently utilizing path indexing for enhanced data processing efficiency.

**Industry Applicability:** This project provides an efficient data collection and management tool for the novel industry, offering robust support and assistance to industry professionals.

### Conclusion

Through my design and implementation of the Automated Novel Data Collection and Management System, I not only demonstrated my programming and data handling capabilities, but also showcased practical application of continuous integration and database management. This project has not only enriched my technical skills but also provides a practical solution for data processing and management in the novel industry.
